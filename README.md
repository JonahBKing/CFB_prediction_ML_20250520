# Using machine learning to predict college football games

  I am doing this project to learn machine learning in python while improving my project organization in VSCode through virtual environments and Jupyter Notebooks.

## This project seeks to

- Predict college football outcomes
- Predict college football outcomes against the spread

## My machine learning will use:

- Past outcomes
- Weighted past opponent strength (offense/defense/special teams)
- Player impact and weighted positional mismatch
- Coach strength/weaknesses
- Other factors???
