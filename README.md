# Using machine learning to predict college football games

  I am doing this project to learn machine learning in python while improving my project organization in VSCode through virtual environments and Jupyter Notebooks.

## This project seeks to

- Predict college football outcomes
- Predict college football outcomes against the spread

## Data

- Using data from [CFBD](https://collegefootballdata.com/)
- [Sample DF](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rS8DA6cI6c3bvgkSLCXAgGebQE_XEjisaoOPMFTlZNo/edit?usp=sharing)

## My machine learning will use:

- Past outcomes
- Weighted past opponent strength (offense/defense/special teams)
- Player impact and weighted positional mismatch
- Coach strength/weaknesses
- Other factors???


## Designing ML 

- I think it will use Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms
    - Kernal functions
- PCA?

## Notes
- Use R and Python in one notebook
