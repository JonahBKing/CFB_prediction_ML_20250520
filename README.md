# Using machine learning to predict college football games

  I am doing this project to learn machine learning in python while improving my project organization in VSCode through virtual environments and Jupyter Notebooks.

## This project seeks to

- Predict college football outcomes
- Predict college football outcomes against the spread

## I need data that has

- Team data for each week
- Offense stats/defense stats (weighted based on past opponents) (maybe FPI?)
- Previous and upcoming opponent strength
- Past coach performance metric
- Player statistics (at least for top performers to input when people are out)

## My machine learning will use:

- Past outcomes
- Weighted past opponent strength (offense/defense/special teams)
- Player impact and weighted positional mismatch
- Coach strength/weaknesses
- Other factors???


## Designing ML 

- I think it will use Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms
